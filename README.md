# Swamp Rabbit Cycling

You will be playing the part of a freelance developer hired by a local company to create a responsive site from a low-fidelity mockup. You will be required to exercise some creativity, or work with others with established design skills, to develop a nice looking website

-------------------

### Company Background
Swamp Rabbit Cycling is the premier (fictional) cycling shop for the Greater Greenville area! We’ve been serving the area for over 25 years and are the number one source for all things bikes. We carry everything from mountain bike equipment to bike related clothing and safety gear. We are a family owned private business and take pride in our long standing tradition of providing the best service in the area.

### Scope and Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an online presence to help promote our unique family owned business. We understand the need for an online presence to serve as a way for our customers to connect with us.

We also understand the need to keep up with current design trends to help market our business. We’ve currently been using the attached clipart to serve as our logo and realize how updating our look will help us grow.

### Single Page Website
While we do have plans to expand our website, we’re currently needing something up and running as soon as possible. Here are some of the items we’ll need by next week (also included in the wireframe):

- Single page where users are able to get our address + contact information
- Etsy product listing of our bikes available in Greenville

The etsy api url to use is: https://api.etsy.com/v2/listings/active.js?api_key=cdwxq4soa7q4zuavbtynj8wx&keywords=bicycle&includes=Images,Shop&sort_on=score

You can swap out the "bicycle" querystring keyword with any search term that you think gives you better results.

Being in a mobile driven age, we understand the importance of being mobile friendly. We’ve created a second wireframe to display the mobile view of a website.
