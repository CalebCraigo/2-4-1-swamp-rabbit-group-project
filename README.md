# Swamp Rabbit Cycling

You will be playing the part of a freelance developer hired by a local company to create a responsive site from a low-fidelity mockup. You will be required to exercise some creativity, or work with others with established design skills, to develop a nice looking website

-------------------

### Company Background
Swamp Rabbit Cycling is the premier (fictional) cycling shop for the Greater Greenville area! We’ve been serving the area for over 25 years and are the number one source for all things bikes. We carry everything from mountain bike equipment to bike related clothing and safety gear. We are a family owned private business and take pride in our long standing tradition of providing the best service in the area.

### Scope and Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an online presence to help promote our unique family owned business. We understand the need for an online presence to serve as a way for our customers to connect with us.

We also understand the need to keep up with current design trends to help market our business. We’ve currently been using the attached clipart to serve as our logo and realize how updating our look will help us grow.
